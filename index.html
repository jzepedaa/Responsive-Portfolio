        <p>
          Jaime Zepeda was born in Chicago on November 17, 1993. He lived the
          majority of his life in the city but eventually branched out to Winona
          Minnesota for his freshman year of college. He soon realized the city
          is home, so he came back to Chicago to then graduate from Roosevelt
          University with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is taking the next steps in the broad Computer Science field by
          being enrolled in Northwestern’s Coding Bootcamp. He feels with the
          skills he has learned and the knowledge he will gain, will help guide
          him to a career full of opportunities within the Computer Sciences
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jaime has always been a team player. Playing soccer his entire life,
          he grew to realize either playing, working, and being in a team
          environment is what is best for him to succeed. Teams can accomplish
          goals together more sufficiently then simply by yourself. He does miss
          being on a competitive soccer team but does know he can take that
          competitiveness and team effort to the workforce and strive for
          success.
